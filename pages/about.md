## About the Collection

This is my attempt to become more familiar with CollectionBuilder. The process is more important (for me) than the content, but I hope browsers enjoy the random images from my cellphone and I hope they are entertained, if even for a moment. While this process can be confusing, the walkthroughs are very helpful. I suggest multiple attempts until you are more familiar with the various steps. This is probably my fifth repository just trying to get everything to work correctly. Good luck!
